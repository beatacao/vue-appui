It is\n * complicated, thus this doc is long and (hopefully) detailed enough to answer\n * your questions.\n *\n * If you need to react to the mouse wheel in a predictable way, this code is\n * like your bestest friend. * hugs *\n *\n * As of today, there are 4 DOM event types you can listen to:\n *\n *   'wheel'                -- Chrome(31+), FF(17+), IE(9+)\n *   'mousewheel'           -- Chrome, IE(6+), Opera, Safari\n *   'MozMousePixelScroll'  -- FF(3.5 only!) (2010-2013) -- don't bother!\n *   'DOMMouseScroll'       -- FF(0.9.7+) since 2003\n *\n * So what to do?  The is the best:\n *\n *   normalizeWheel.getEventType();\n *\n * In your event callback, use this code to get sane interpretation of the\n * deltas.  This code will return an object with properties:\n *\n *   spinX   -- normalized spin speed (use for zoom) - x plane\n *   spinY   -- \" - y plane\n *   pixelX  -- normalized distance (to pixels) - x plane\n *   pixelY  -- \" - y plane\n *\n * Wheel values are provided by the browser assuming you are using the wheel to\n * scroll a web page by a number of lines or pixels (or pages).  Values can vary\n * significantly on different platforms and browsers, forgetting that you can\n * scroll at different speeds.  Some devices (like trackpads) emit more events\n * at smaller increments with fine granularity, and some emit massive jumps with\n * linear speed or acceleration.\n *\n * This code does its best to normalize the deltas for you:\n *\n *   - spin is trying to normalize how far the wheel was spun (or trackpad\n *     dragged).  This is super useful for zoom support where you want to\n *     throw away the chunky scroll steps on the PC and make those equal to\n *     the slow and smooth tiny steps on the Mac. Key data: This code tries to\n *     resolve a single slow step on a wheel to 1.\n *\n *   - pixel is normalizing the desired scroll delta in pixel units.  You'll\n *     get the crazy differences between browsers, but at least it'll be in\n *     pixels!\n *\n *   - positive value indicates scrolling DOWN/RIGHT, negative UP/LEFT.  This\n *     should translate to positive value zooming IN, negative zooming OUT.\n *     This matches the newer 'wheel' event.\n *\n * Why are there spinX, spinY (or pixels)?\n *\n *   - spinX is a 2-finger side drag on the trackpad, and a shift + wheel turn\n *     with a mouse.  It results in side-scrolling in the browser by default.\n *\n *   - spinY is what you expect -- it's the classic axis of a mouse wheel.\n *\n *   - I dropped spinZ/pixelZ.  It is supported by the DOM 3 'wheel' event and\n *     probably is by browsers in conjunction with fancy 3D controllers .. but\n *     you know.\n *\n * Implementation info:\n *\n * Examples of 'wheel' event if you scroll slowly (down) by one step with an\n * average mouse:\n *\n *   OS X + Chrome  (mouse)     -    4   pixel delta  (wheelDelta -120)\n *   OS X + Safari  (mouse)     -  N/A   pixel delta  (wheelDelta  -12)\n *   OS X + Firefox (mouse)     -    0.1 line  delta  (wheelDelta  N/A)\n *   Win8 + Chrome  (mouse)     -  100   pixel delta  (wheelDelta -120)\n *   Win8 + Firefox (mouse)     -    3   line  delta  (wheelDelta -120)\n *\n * On the trackpad:\n *\n *   OS X + Chrome  (trackpad)  -    2   pixel delta  (wheelDelta   -6)\n *   OS X + Firefox (trackpad)  -    1   pixel delta  (wheelDelta  N/A)\n *\n * On other/older browsers.. it's more complicated as there can be multiple and\n * also missing delta values.\n *\n * The 'wheel' event is more standard:\n *\n * http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/#events-wheelevents\n *\n * The basics is that it includes a unit, deltaMode (pixels, lines, pages), and\n * deltaX, deltaY and deltaZ.  Some browsers provide other values to maintain\n * backward compatibility with older events.  Those other values help us\n * better normalize spin speed.  Example of what the browsers provide:\n *\n *                          | event.wheelDelta | event.detail\n *        ------------------+------------------+--------------\n *          Safari v5/OS X  |       -120       |       0\n *          Safari v5/Win7  |       -120       |       0\n *         Chrome v17/OS X  |       -120       |       0\n *         Chrome v17/Win7  |       -120       |       0\n *                IE9/Win7  |       -120       |   undefined\n *         Firefox v4/OS X  |     undefined    |       1\n *         Firefox v4/Win7  |     undefined    |       3\n *\n */\nfunction normalizeWheel(/*object*/ event) /*object*/ {\n  var sX = 0, sY = 0,       // spinX, spinY\n      pX = 0, pY = 0;       // pixelX, pixelY\n\n  // Legacy\n  if ('detail'      in event) { sY = event.detail; }\n  if ('wheelDelta'  in event) { sY = -event.wheelDelta / 120; }\n  if ('wheelDeltaY' in event) { sY = -event.wheelDeltaY / 120; }\n  if ('wheelDeltaX' in event) { sX = -event.wheelDeltaX / 120; }\n\n  // side scrolling on FF with DOMMouseScroll\n  if ( 'axis' in event && event.axis === event.HORIZONTAL_AXIS ) {\n    sX = sY;\n    sY = 0;\n  }\n\n  pX = sX * PIXEL_STEP;\n  pY = sY * PIXEL_STEP;\n\n  if ('deltaY' in event) { pY = event.deltaY; }\n  if ('deltaX' in event) { pX = event.deltaX; }\n\n  if ((pX || pY) && event.deltaMode) {\n    if (event.deltaMode == 1) {          // delta in LINE units\n      pX *= LINE_HEIGHT;\n      pY *= LINE_HEIGHT;\n    } else {                             // delta in PAGE units\n      pX *= PAGE_HEIGHT;\n      pY *= PAGE_HEIGHT;\n    }\n  }\n\n  // Fall-back if spin cannot be determined\n  if (pX && !sX) { sX = (pX < 1) ? -1 : 1; }\n  if (pY && !sY) { sY = (pY < 1) ? -1 : 1; }\n\n  return { spinX  : sX,\n           spinY  : sY,\n           pixelX : pX,\n           pixelY : pY };\n}\n\n\n/**\n * The best combination if you prefer spinX + spinY normalization.

You should prefer\n *  the non-deprecated UserAgent module when possible, which exposes our\n *  authoritative server-side PHP-based detection to the client.\n *\n *  Usage is straightforward:\n *\n *    if (UserAgent_DEPRECATED.ie()) {\n *      //  IE\n *    }\n *\n *  You can also do version checks:\n *\n *    if (UserAgent_DEPRECATED.ie() >= 7) {\n *      //  IE7 or better\n *    }\n *\n *  The browser functions will return NaN if the browser does not match, so\n *  you can also do version compares the other way:\n *\n *    if (UserAgent_DEPRECATED.ie() < 7) {\n *      //  IE6 or worse\n *    }\n *\n *  Note that the version is a float and may include a minor version number,\n *  so you should always use range operators to perform comparisons, not\n *  strict equality.\n *\n *  **Note:** You should **strongly** prefer capability detection to browser\n *  version detection where it's reasonable:\n *\n *    http://www.quirksmode.org/js/support.html\n *\n *  Further, we have a large number of mature wrapper functions and classes\n *  which abstract away many browser irregularities. Check the documentation,\n *  grep for things, or ask on javascript@lists.facebook.com before writing yet\n *  another copy of \"event || window.event\".\n *\n */\n\nvar _populated = false;\n\n// Browsers\nvar _ie, _firefox, _opera, _webkit, _chrome;\n\n// Actual IE browser for compatibility mode\nvar _ie_real_version;\n\n// Platforms\nvar _osx, _windows, _linux, _android;\n\n// Architectures\nvar _win64;\n\n// Devices\nvar _iphone, _ipad, _native;\n\nvar _mobile;\n\nfunction _populate() {\n  if (_populated) {\n    return;\n  }\n\n  _populated = true;\n\n  // To work around buggy JS libraries that can't handle multi-digit\n  // version numbers, Opera 10's user agent string claims it's Opera\n  // 9, then later includes a Version/X.Y field:\n  //\n  // Opera/9.80 (foo) Presto/2.2.15 Version/10.10\n  var uas = navigator.userAgent;\n  var agent = /(?:MSIE.(\\d+\\.\\d+))|(?:(?:Firefox|GranParadiso|Iceweasel).(\\d+\\.\\d+))|(?:Opera(?:.+Version.|.)(\\d+\\.\\d+))|(?:AppleWebKit.(\\d+(?:\\.\\d+)?))|(?:Trident\\/\\d+\\.\\d+.*rv:(\\d+\\.\\d+))/.exec(uas);\n  var os    = /(Mac OS X)|(Windows)|(Linux)/.exec(uas);\n\n  _iphone = /\\b(iPhone|iP[ao]d)/.exec(uas);\n  _ipad = /\\b(iP[ao]d)/.exec(uas);\n  _android = /Android/i.exec(uas);\n  _native = /FBAN\\/\\w+;/i.exec(uas);\n  _mobile = /Mobile/i.exec(uas);\n\n  // Note that the IE team blog would have you believe you should be checking\n  // for 'Win64; x64'.
